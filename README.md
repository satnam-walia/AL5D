## About The Project

To use the AL5D arm, you must first connect the power adapter onto then, connect pin 7 of the BBB onto RX of the arm, and GND to the ground of the arm.

The Arm has 3 different modes:
1.	Jog Mode-user control the arm using the keyboard.
2.	Web Mode-User can control the arm using website.
3.	Algo Mode-Arm will move from point A to point B automatically.

The user can select the mode that they desire to use by enable via the website button. If Web and Algo switches are disables, the user is in Jog mode. Note that the user must press the submit button to notify the arm which mode it is in.

The angles values are only submitted onto the text file when the Web mode button is enabled.
Algo mode can only be accessed via the website. Make sure to place the arm in an open area to avoid damaging it.
